# Ridge_Control_Using_Arduino

There is a separate machine which acts like a ridge, and controls the door for water to enter and leave the fields based on requirement.

If the water level is sufficient for the crops or soil, the machine locks the ridges, stores the water for crops. Without man power the machine act like a man and makes the ridges automatically based on the water consumption. By using soil moisture sensor, we can also able to get updates about the soil and water level management.

We can also do humidity check and machine can control the water flow to the plants when it needed by using sensors. Identification and prevention of Water saving will be done with the help of our project and Plants/Paddy fields can be maintained water level and Ridges will be Maintained automatically. 

Automation of Ridges system can be maintained and it can be placed in any type of plant fields and crops.


# Methodology

	With the help of soil moisture sensors, we will be able to get the details about the field and crops. Water level is the main concept of our project. Maintaining water level for the crops and fields are off very important so as to maintain the health of the crops.
	The proposed mechanism acts like ridges. It opens up when the water level of the fields is too high, without the man power the machine acts like a door and gives a way for the fields. 
	The water level will be captured from the water level sensors and soil moisture sensors. When the water level is low the ridges will be in closed condition so that the water reaches a standard level for the plants. If the water level is too high the door opens for the water to leave the fields.

# Expected outcomes

  Identification and prevention of Water saving will be done with the help of our project and Plants/Paddy fields can be maintained water level and Ridges will be Maintained automatically.
  
  Automation of Ridges system can be maintained and it can be placed in any type of plant fields and crops
